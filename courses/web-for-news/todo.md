(06:18:05 PM) mtigas: okay, so i think we're going to try to release an updated version soon (current latest thing is only available if you click 'archive' on http://jazzido.github.io/tabula/ )
(06:18:32 PM) mtigas: which will have fancier features than people had previously seen -- tries to automatically detect tables, lets you select multiple pages at once, etc
(06:19:07 PM) mtigas: i guess an important thing to file away in the memorybanks is that we have https://github.com/jazzido/tabula-extractor which is the sort of back end detection library we've written
(06:19:19 PM) mtigas: which you can use in other jruby projects and also on the command line
(06:19:29 PM) mtigas: basically tabula without the web UI
