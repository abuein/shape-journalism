## The map is not the territory

### Map projections

Map projections are necessary for creating maps. _All map projections **distort** the surface_ in some fashion. Depending on the _purpose_ of the map, some distortions are acceptable and others are not; therefore different _map projections exist in order to **preserve** some properties_ of the sphere-like body _at the expense of other properties._

#### Mercator projection

The Mercator projection is a cylindrical map projection presented by the Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569.

It is the standard map projection for nautical purposes because of its ability to represent lines of constant course, known as rhumb lines or **loxodromes**, as straight segments which conserve the angles with the meridians.

### Map projection distorsions 

#### Mercator distorsion

The classic way of showing the distortion inherent in a projection is to use _Tissot's indicatrix._

* Greenland takes as much space on the map as Africa, when in reality Africa's area is 14 times greater.
* Alaska takes as much area on the map as Brazil, when Brazil's area is nearly 5 times that of Alaska.
* Finland appears with a greater north-south extent than India, although India's is greater.
* Antarctica appears as the biggest continent, although it is actually the fifth in terms of area.

Jason Davies in [Distances from North Korea](http://www.jasondavies.com/maps/north-korea-distance/) notes:

> BBC News has been illustrating North Korean missile ranges using an _orthographic projection_ centred at North Korea. Unfortunately, this is slightly misleading, as _distances measured relative to the centre are not preserved under this projection, particularly near the edges._ Furthermore, the orthographic projection is limited to a single hemisphere at a time, and so _much of the U.S. mainland is not shown, despite it being of interest to the story._

## Precession of Simulacra

> "Today abstraction is no longer that of the map, the double, the mirror, or the concept. Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being or substance. It is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: A hyperreal. The territory no longer precedes the map, nor does it survive it. It is nevertheless the map that precedes the territory - precession of simulacra - that engenders the territory." -- Baudrillard, [Simulacra and Simulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation)

1. The first stage is a faithful image/copy
2. The second stage is perversion of reality
3. The third stage masks the absence of a profound reality, where the simulacrum pretends to be a faithful copy, but it is a copy with no original. 
4. The fourth stage is pure simulation, in which the simulacrum has no relationship to any reality whatsoever.
