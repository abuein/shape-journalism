2. Tools of the trade
=====================

2.1 Browsers - Gotta Catch Them All
-----------------------------------

You should install at least two browsers with different rendering engines.

This is the lay of the land as far as rendering engines are concerned:

* Chrome - Blink
* Firefox - Gecko
* Internet Explorer - Trident
* Safari - Webkit
* Opera - Blink

You may find that you cannot install certain browsers on your operating system. If you really want to try them out you can use Virtual Machines such as [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and install the required OS and browser in there.

At the end of the day working in the technology area of a newsroom, you should have access to all major browsers, for comprehensive testing.

2.2 Debugging
-------------

Chrome and Firefox's built-in developer tools seem to be most developer's weapon of choice of when it comes to debugging.

Also don't be afraid to write values to the console, using command such as consol.log and console.dir. console.log prints a simple string to the screen whereas console.dir display the breakdown of an object or element.

For mobile devices you can use:

* [JS Console](http://jsconsole.com/)
* [Weinre](http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre/docs/latest/)
* [iWebinspector](http://www.iwebinspector.com/)
* [Aardwolf](https://github.com/lexandera/Aardwolf)

The trick is to be able to manipulate the mobile page from your desktop.

2.3 Version Control
-------------------

You probably have access to a version control system but it's important to get used popular versioning systems such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/). In this course we will make extensive use of GitHub.

A lot of great libraries come out of newsrooms and the majority of them are made available on GitHub, it's important to realise the power of community and to make modules that not only you, but the wider community can use.

###GitHub

We're going to publish all our exercises on GitHub so let's make sure we all have our accounts set up and are pushing code onto GitHub on a regular basis.

2.4 Collborative Coding
-----------------------

Sharing snippets of code and allowing people to edit them is a great way of moving forward. There are several tools you may investigate for these purposes:

* [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/)
* [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/)
* [Codepen](http://codepen.io/)
* [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/)

We're going to use JS Bin for the purposes of our course.

2.5 Compatibility
-----------------

There are a few sites that have compatability tables for various browser technologies. One good one is [CanIUse.com](http://caniuse.com/)


2.6 Testing
