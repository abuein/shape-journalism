2.1 Canvas
----------

You can think of canvas as a drawing surface for a web-page. If you knew HTML pre-canvas you'll this was difficult to do without using plugins like Flash. Canvas offers a way of writing pixels, lines and shapes to the screen in an intuitive way. You can read and write all the pixels of a particular canvas, you can even apply canvases to other HTML5 elements.

Although Canvas may look vector-based, it is actually rasterised, which means if you zoom in, you'll start to see the pixels.
