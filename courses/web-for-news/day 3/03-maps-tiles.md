# Creating and using raster tiles

## Google Styled Maps

Styled maps allow you to customise the presentation of the standard Google base maps, changing the visual display of such elements as roads, parks, and built-up areas.

Tools: [Google Maps Colorizr](http://software.stadtwerk.org/google_maps_colorizr/) or [Google Style Maps Wizard](http://gmaps-samples-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/styledmaps/wizard/index.html)

## Stamen Maps

* Toner: These high-contrast B+W (black and white) maps are featured in our Dotspotting project. They are perfect for data mashups and exploring river meanders and coastal zones.
* Terrain: featuring hill shading and natural vegetation colors. 
* Watercolor: Reminiscent of hand drawn maps, our watercolor maps apply raster effect area washes and organic edges over a paper texture to add warm pop to any map.

## [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/showcase/)

Raster tiles provider, has own publishing tools, analytics, etc.

Created TileMill, a tools to style geographical data with CartoCSS, a CSS-like styling language for maps.

**Demo: [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/showcase/)**

**Demo: [TileMill](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/) with various data sources.**

Note: GeoTiff require _raster-scaling: bilinear;_ (see [Working with GeoTIFFs](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/reprojecting-geotiff/))



### [MapBox.js](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/example/v1.0.0/)

Based on [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com)

Exercise: create a MapBox.js map based on the [basic example](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/)

Discussion: Datavis Example (Choropleth)

### Leaftlet.js

1st example: [Choropleth](http://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth.html) (similar with MapBox, which is based on leaflet anyway)

Exploration: [Leaflet Plugins](http://leafletjs.com/plugins.html)
